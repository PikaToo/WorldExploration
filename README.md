# WorldExploration
A metroidvania game. Level design is not complete, but the game features: 
- 6 enemies and 2 bosses
- 50 screens
- 4 upgrades

Though the game has some save/load functionality, it has not been properly implemented. I wanted to try to include something like the saving akin to that of Elements For Money, another project of mine, but ended up focusing my time on other projects instead.

Reaching the end of the game crashes it, as you eventually fall into a level that is not in the list of levels. 

## How To Play
### 1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Pygame installed
You can install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/.
To install Pygame, type `pip install pygame` in the terminal of either a virtual environment or your global system.

### 2. Run the script
Run main.py by typing `python main.py` while your terminal is in the directory. 

### 3. Click New Game
Note that loading should be treated as, for all intents and purposes, not functioning. Clicking Load Game will have no way of going back, either, so ideally don't click it. 

You can move using WASD and pause/unpause using Escape. 

Other controls are explained during the game.
